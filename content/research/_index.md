# Overview

SgCALE provides scalable and predictive weather and climate analytics that can accurately and seamlessly simulate extreme weather events across various temporal (hourly, daily, sub-seasonal, seasonal, and decadal) and spatial (e.g., building, community, city) scales, mitigate their impacts in real-time, and enable collaboration with various stakeholders to provide tailored guidance towards climate-resilient city planning.
