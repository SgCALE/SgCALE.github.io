# Introduction of SgCALE

Our mission to build Singaporeâ€™s Climate ArtificiaL intelligence Engine (SgCALE) to predict highly-localized urban climate extremes (e.g., inland flooding, coastal flooding) harnessing machine learning. SgCALE provides scalable and predictive weather and climate analytics that can accurately and seamlessly simulate extreme weather events across various temporal (hourly, daily, sub-seasonal, seasonal, and decadal) and spatial (e.g., building, community, city) scales, mitigate their impacts in real-time, and enable collaboration with various stakeholders, including HDB,
to provide tailored guidance towards climate-resilient city planning.
