Addressing climate change, one innovative application at a time.

## [Extreme Weather Prediction](https://sgcale-weather.streamlit.app/)

Weather prediction app for Singapore, using ConvLSTM models.

The **Extreme Weather Prediction** web app is capable of predicting daily precipitation of our area of study from 2015 to 2020. While using the web app, the user can select their timestep of interest and compare the predicted results with the WRF simulated data, which serves as our “true” data for comparison. Additionally, the web app can also show the computed Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) values for the predicted and WRF simulated precipitation.

Additionally, the web app offers more features, such as the ability to compare and analyze the predictions of the model with the WRF simulated data for any given waterbodies across Singapore! Try out the web app and explore the results for yourself [here](https://sgcale-weather.streamlit.app/)!
