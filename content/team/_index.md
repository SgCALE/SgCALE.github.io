# Meet The Team

We are a group of AI enthusiasts with diverse backgrounds in climate science, hydrology, earth system modeling, and civil and environmental engineering. Our mission is to build Singaporeâ€™s Climate ArtificiaL intelligence Engine (SgCALE) to predict highly-localized urban climate extremes (e.g., floods, droughts, heat waves) harnessing machine learning.
