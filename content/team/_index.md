# Meet The Team

We are a group of AI enthusiasts with a diverse background in climate science, hydrology, Earth system modeling, and civil and environmental engineering. Our mission is to build Singaporeâ€™s Climate ArtificiaL intelligence Engine (SgCALE) to predict highly-localized urban climate extremes (e.g., floods, droughts, heat waves) harnessing machine learning.
